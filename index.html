			<h2> Introduction </h2>
			<p>I'm currently a student at Adelphi University studying Computer Science with a concentration in Information Security. I'm always eager to learn more about computers, cyber security, and assist people with their inquiries as well.</p> 
			<p>For me cyber security has always been an interesting topic where we are always trying to solve some type of puzzle. We have to find the clues in a system in order to break into it and have access to the information. Just how attackers have to find these clues, as defenders we have to make sure that there are no vulnerabilities. An attacker only has to be successful once while a defender has to be successful 100% of the time.  Computers and computer security has become one of my favorite topics and I am always looking to increase my knowledge about it. </p>
